## About MELT

MELT is a free, open source, testing library for the .NET Standard _Microsoft Extension Logging_ library.
It is a solution to easily test logs.

It is a repackaging with some changes and omissions of [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Testing](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/tree/master/src/Logging/Logging.Testing), a library used internally in [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) for testing the logging, given that [there is currently no plan to offer an official package for it](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/issues/672#issuecomment-532850535).

It is licensed under [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/alefranz/MELT/blob/master/LICENSE).
Most of the code is copyrighted by the .NET Foundation as mentioned in the files headers.
